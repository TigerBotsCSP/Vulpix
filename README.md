Vulpix is skeleton code for our future swerve robot. The code just needs playing around with numbers until it's ready to be put on an actual swerve bot!
<br>
<br>
The code uses CAN Spark Maxes as the motor controllers. All eight NEO motors should each have a built-in encoder. Also, don't forget the navX MXP Gyro connected to the roboRIO!
